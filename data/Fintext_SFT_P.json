        "output": "\n1. Understanding Inflation: Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, purchasing power is falling. Central banks attempt to limit inflation, and avoid deflation, in order to keep the economy running smoothly.\n\n2. Data Sources: Accurate inflation rates are typically sourced from national statistics agencies or international financial organizations. For the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides monthly updates on the CPI, which is used to calculate the inflation rate.\n\n3. Calculation Method: The inflation rate is calculated by taking the percentage change in the CPI over a specific period. For example, the annual inflation rate for 2018 would be calculated by comparing the CPI at the end of 2018 to the CPI at the end of 2017, and then expressing the change as a percentage."

        "output": "\n1. Understanding the Source: The average rate of increase in salaries is often reported by government agencies or financial institutions. It is important to identify the source of this data to ensure its reliability and accuracy.\n\n2. Calculation Method: The rate of increase is typically calculated by comparing the average salary levels at two different points in time (e.g., the beginning and end of the year) and determining the percentage change. This involves using the formula: [(New Salary - Old Salary) / Old Salary] * 100%.\n\n3. Contextual Factors: Various factors can influence salary increases, including inflation, economic growth, labor market conditions, and industry-specific trends. Understanding these factors can provide insights into why the average rate of increase is at a certain level.\n\nIn this case, the answer is given as 2.7%, indicating that the average rate of increase in salaries for 2019 was 2.7%. This figure would have been derived from an analysis of salary data collected over the year."
